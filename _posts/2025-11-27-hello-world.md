Welcome to my blog — Hello World!

This is a minimal "Hello World" post to confirm the Jekyll site is publishing posts correctly.

Quick notes:

- To preview locally (requires Ruby, Bundler, and Jekyll):

	```sh
	bundle install
	bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
	```

	Then open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser.

- To publish, commit and push to the `main` branch on GitHub; GitHub Pages will build and serve the site.

Enjoy — let me know if you want a custom layout, hero image, or metadata added to this post.

Thanks,  
Arul
