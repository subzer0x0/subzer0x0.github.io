This short post shows how to run the React2Shell vulnerable lab locally using Docker. The instructions are simple and repeatable — ideal for spinning up a disposable environment for learning or testing CVE-2025-55182.

Important: run this lab only in isolated environments you control (local VM or disposable container). Do NOT target systems you do not own or lack explicit permission to test.

**Quick Steps**

1. Clone the lab repository from GitHub.
2. Build the Docker image (or pull the published image).
3. Run the container and open the app at http://localhost:3000

## Clone the repository

Open a terminal and run:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/subzer0x0/React2Shell.git
cd React2Shell
```

## Option A — Build from source (recommended for development)

Build the Docker image locally and run it:

```cmd
docker build -t react2shell:latest .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 react2shell:latest
```

Then open: http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- The container binds port `3000` on the host. If that port is in use, change the left side of `-p` (for example `-p 8080:3000`).

## Option B — Pull prebuilt image (fast)

If you prefer to use the published image from Docker Hub, pull and run it:

```cmd
docker pull arulkumarv/react2shell:v1
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 arulkumarv/react2shell:v1
```

🔬 Exploit Proof‑of‑Concept (PoC)

A public PoC related to CVE-2025-55182 is available at: https://github.com/msanft/CVE-2025-55182

To fetch and run the PoC locally (only in an isolated lab):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/msanft/CVE-2025-55182
cd CVE-2025-55182
python poc.py
```
